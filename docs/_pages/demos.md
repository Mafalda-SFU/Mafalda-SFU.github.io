To see how simple is to migrate from Mediasoup to Mafalda SFU, you can can take
a look on the
[Remote Mediasoup client mock](https://github.com/Mafalda-SFU/Remote-Mediasoup-client-mock)
module to see yourself how easy would be to migrate your own projects codebase
and prepare it to work with Mafalda SFU.

You can also check some examples in our
[blog](https://mafalda.io/2025/03/31/How-to-scale-EduMeet-(or-any-Mediasoup-application)-with-Mafalda-SFU.html)

videoconferencing application to use Mafalda SFU, or look on our
[EduMeet fork](https://github.com/Mafalda-SFU/EduMeet-Mafalda) repository for
real world code examples.
