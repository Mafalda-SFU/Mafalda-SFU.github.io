## What is Mafalda SFU?

Mafalda SFU is a suite of software packages that allows to create and manage
WebRTC audio and video conference rooms and media streaming sessions with
thousands of participants over multiple servers, in a fully automated way.

Built on top of [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/), one of the
[most performant](https://webrtchacks.com/revealing-mediasoups-core-ingredients-qa-with-inaki-baz-castillo/#post-3927-_Toc119228912)
Open Source SFUs, Mafalda SFU allows to:

- by-pass [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) by-design single-threaded
  limitations and provides full multi-threaded and multi-server support
- provides vertical and horizontal scalability in a transparent way for both
  apps code, users and developers
- manages itself the allocation and balancing of resources in the most optimal
  way
- and all of it, with the only limit of the provided hardware resources

You only need to focus on your application logic, and Mafalda SFU will take care
of management of the media scalability over all your CPUs and servers for you.
Following development best practices, code is split in multiple modules with a
common API, allowing to combine between them in the most optimal way for your
specific use case.

## Who is Mafalda SFU for?

Since idea conception in March 2021, started development as a proof of concept
in April 2021, and first public comments about its development in
[May](https://twitter.com/el_piranna/status/1396126065677021193),
[June](https://mediasoup.discourse.group/t/for-a-snippet-of-code-for-horizontal-scaling-using-pipetransports/2790/11) and
[July](https://mediasoup.discourse.group/t/presenting-mafalda-sfu/3067) of
2021, Mafalda SFU has been receiving interest from companies on different
sectors, like:

- Development of videoconferencing platforms and SDKs
- Videoconferencing and audio/video applications with high number of concurrent
  rooms or participants
- Low latency media streaming and distribution applications
- 2D/3D/VR metaverses & social platforms
- Multi-source 3D audio applications
- Online real-time education platforms

Mafalda SFU also allows to scale current [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/)
based videoconference applications without needing to change their application
logic. Just by replacing [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) with Mafalda SFU,
and configure and initialize the library, you can scale your application to
thousands of participants in a matter of minutes.

## What Mafalda SFU scalability solution better suits me?

Mafalda SFU modularity makes it ery flexible regarding use cases or architecture
designs, but we have had a set of common use cases we have seen when working on
other previous projects. That doesn't means that Mafalda SFU would not be able
to work in other scenarios, nor we could not be able to adapt it to your use case on demand, but theses ones show how much versatile Mafalda SFU can be.

### Lots of small sized rooms (each one under a single CPU capacity limits)?

*Horizontal scalability*, also known as *scale out*: `Mediasoup Cluster` controlling several `Remote Mediasoup server` instances running on top of vanilla `Mediasoup`. Alternatively, `Mediasoup-horizontal` can be used standalone (running in local) to control the `Remote Mediasoup server` instances, but it's not recommended for performance and stability reasons.

### One medium sized room (under capacity limits of multi-CPUs single server)?

*Vertical scalability*, also known as *scale up*: `Mediasoup Vertical` running on top of vanilla `Mediasoup`, aggregating all the systems resources and offering them to the application as if running on a single, huge CPU.

### Some medium sized rooms (under capacity limits of each single server)?

Cluster of `Mediasoup Vertical`s (*horizontal-over-vertical* scalability): `Mediasoup Cluster` controlling several `Remote Mediasoup server` instances running on top of `Mediasoup-Vertical`. This is not provided as a standalone product, but instead it's offered as an architecture configuration option.

### One or a few of big sized rooms (expanding over multiple servers)?

`Mediasoup vertical cluster` (*vertical-over-horizontal* scalability, also known as *aggregated scalability*): `Mediasoup-vertical` running on top of `Mediasoup-horizontal`, controlling several `Remote Mediasoup server` instances running on top of vanilla `Mediasoup`. For performance reasons, it's encouraged the `Remote Mediasoup server` instances make use of the `Mediasoup Vertical` module themselves (for example, being `Remote Mediasoup vertical server`, `Remote vertical proxy`, or `Remote vertical cluster` instances), to improve closer locality of related Mediasoup `Worker`s in a room.

## Mafalda SFU ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source

Mafalda SFU is build on top of multiple Open Source projects, being
[Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) the most prominent one. In addition to that,
during development of Mafalda SFU we have created and published multiple
auxiliary Open Source projects and contributed to several others, between
dependencies, tools, demos, reporters, forks... You can find a list of all our
Open Source repositories and contribution forks at
[Mafalda SFU Github organization](https://github.com/Mafalda-SFU), at
[Mafalda SFU NPM organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mafalda-sfu), and a

## FAQ

### Where does the name of Mafalda SFU come from?

Name of the project has been taken as a tribute to
[Mafalda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafalda), the character created by
Joaqu√≠n Salvador Lavado Tej√≥n '[Quino](https://www.quino.com.ar/homequino)',
that has a love-hate relationship with both *mass media* and soup üòâ

### What's the Mafalda SFU projects code coverage?

Most of the main dependencies and auxiliary projects have more than 80% code
coverage (in some cases that gets up to 100% code coverage for both statements,
branches and functions). For all main and core Mafalda SFU projects, code
coverage gets up to more than 90%.

### Will Mafalda SFU allows me to display thousands of participants in a single room?

**TL;DR:** Not by itself, but we can help you to achieve it.

In a similar way to how [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) does, Mafalda SFU
works like a library that allows to create and manage WebRTC audio and video
conference rooms and media streaming sessions with thousands of participants at
the same time over multiple servers, in a fully automated way. The bottleneck in
this case is the number of participants that can be played at the same time,
that's not a limitation of [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) or Mafalda SFU,
but of the browser or mobile app clients that are playing them, and the capacity
of the computer or mobile phone they are running on top of. Several tests has
shown that Chrome browser in a regular Intel i7 laptop can smoothly play up to 16 videos at the same time, starting to be unstable with 20-25 videos, and being
practically useless with 30 or more videos, also with low resolution and
framerate. On mobile phones and tablets devices, it's not practical to show more
than 6 videos a the same time, mostly due to screen space available.

In addition to that practical hardware or bandwidth limits from the clients
side, Chrome itself imposed a hard limit of
[200 tracks (audio or video) on desktop and 100 tracks on mobile](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/9e03c50a4b268bbca6f2cba903131b88072420d7%5E%21/#F0)
due to these quality issues, although it was later uplift to
[1000 tracks](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/f7489718ee87fbef92c59d35d9437cf55466fa2c%5E%21/#F0)
until a better solution was implemented since there was
[critics](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1232649) from
developers of high demanding web applications, but as of January 2024 it's still
[not implemented](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1144736).

If your application needs to play more streams than the browser or mobile app
can handle, you can use Mafalda SFU to manage the media streams and distribute
them to the clients, but you'll need to implement your own logic to display
them in a way that is useful for your application. For example, in a video
conference app you can have a layout where only the most recently active users
are being shown, and push back others to a list, so you can mute or stop their
video tracks and only play the audio of that less recently active participants,
or in a metaverse you can play the audio of the closest avatars, saving both CPU
processing and bandwidth at the same time.

Mafalda SFU team have been involved in the past in projects with similar
requirements (that's one of the reasons we started Mafalda SFU project on the
first place), and we are capable of offer you consultancy services to help you
define what's the best architecture for your particular use case and needs, or
also we can be able to implement it for you.
