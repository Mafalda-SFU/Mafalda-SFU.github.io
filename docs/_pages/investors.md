## What is Mafalda SFU?

Mafalda SFU is a suite of combinable software packages that provides an API
compatible with [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/), and allows to host audio
and video conference rooms and media streaming sessions with thousands of
participants at the same time.

## What does it do now?

It aggregates the capacity of several CPU cores distributed over multiple
servers as if they were a single one, and allows to create and manage WebRTC and
media streaming sessions with thousands of participants in a fully automated
way. We can also offer remote Mediasoup instances as a SaaS, so developers only
need to focus on their application logic, and Mafalda SFU will take care of
management of the media scalability.

## What can it do in the future?

It is designed to handle thousands of simultaneous participants, only limited by
the number of servers added to the system. Actual load testing has not yet been
performed: since 100% compatibility with Mediasoup API is a self-imposed
requirement, the development has focused primarily on API completeness and
project robustness.

Other future features include:

- Automatic spin-up server instances on demand.
- Monitor in real time the usage and capacity of all servers and clients.
- Create a global P2P decentralized streaming network.

## What does it needs to do it?

Project is already feature complete, and the API is 100% compatible with
Mediasoup tests. Current efforts are focused on implement load tests and
improve the documentation. We are looking for investors and partners to both
raise funds to help us with the development of the project, and more specially
for marketing and to prospect for new clients and opportunities.

      Start a project with a cloud provider because it's easy and fast, but find

      run once project grows, and need a full rewrite to migrate to a different

      Based on Mediasoup API, no need to change the application logic nor learn
