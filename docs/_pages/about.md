## What is Mafalda SFU?

Mafalda SFU is a suite of software packages that allows to create and manage
WebRTC audio and video conference rooms and media streaming sessions with
thousands of participants over multiple servers, in a fully automated way.

Built on top of [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/), one of the
[most performant](https://webrtchacks.com/revealing-mediasoups-core-ingredients-qa-with-inaki-baz-castillo/#post-3927-_Toc119228912)
Open Source SFUs, Mafalda SFU allows to:

- by-pass Mediasoup by-design single-threaded limitations, and provide full
  multi-threaded and multi-server support
- provide vertical and horizontal scalability in a transparent way for both apps
  code, users and developers
- manages itself the allocation and balancing of resources in the most optimal
  way
- and all of it, with the only limit of the provided hardware resources

You only need to focus on your application logic, and Mafalda SFU will take care
of management of the media scalability over all your CPUs and servers for you.
Following development best practices, code is split in multiple
[packages](/projects/) with a common API, allowing to combine between them in
the most optimal way for your specific use case.

## Who is Mafalda SFU for?

Since idea conception in March 2021, Mafalda SFU has received interest from
companies on different sectors, like:

- Development of videoconferencing platforms and SDKs
- Videoconferencing and audio/video applications with high number of concurrent
  rooms or participants
- Low latency media streaming and distribution applications
- 2D/3D/VR metaverses & social platforms
- Multi-source 3D audio applications
- Online real-time education platforms

Mafalda SFU also allows to scale current Mediasoup based videoconference
applications without needing to change their application logic. Just by
replacing Mediasoup with Mafalda SFU, and configure and initialize the library,
you can scale your application to thousands of participants in a matter of
minutes.

## A [Jesús Leganés-Combarro](https://piranna.github.io) project

With more than 20 years of experience in software development, and being one of
Spain first WebRTC experts and pioneers since 2012 when he developed
[ShareIt!](https://piranna.github.io/projects/#shareit), the World's first
in-browser P2P file sharing application, and
[DataChannel-polyfill](https://github.com/ShareIt-project/DataChannel-polyfill),
the first working implementation of WebRTC DataChannel specification,
[Jesús Leganés-Combarro](https://piranna.github.io) has been working on development of real-time and high performant applications since 2008 for
companies like [Kurento](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (now
part of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)),
[Telefónica](https://www.telefonica.com), [Atos](https://atos.net),
[IE University](https://www.ie.edu), [Dyte](https://dyte.io), or
[TRC](https://grupotrc.com/) and Spain's army. He has also worked hand-to-hand
with other world-renowned WebRTC experts and pioneers like
[Iñaki Baz Castillo](https://inakibaz.me/) (creator of Mediasoup itself),
[Sergio Garcia Murillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiogarciamurillo/),
[Professor Luis Lopez Fernandez](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/luis.lopez),
or [Tsahi Levent-Levi](https://bloggeek.me), among others.
