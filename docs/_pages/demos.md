To see how much simple is to migrate from Mediasoup to Mafalda SFU, check the
[example repo](https://github.com/Mafalda-SFU/EduMeet-Mafalda/compare/03d78e9dfcf19106a69278c1506c3618730bf734...303be91a6739698b5ba9bb0e49c6f040a20ca92c)
migrating [EduMeet](https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet) to use Mafalda SFU. You
can also check on the
[Remote Mediasoup client mock](https://github.com/Mafalda-SFU/Remote-Mediasoup-client-mock)
module to check yourself how much easy would be to migrate your own codebase to
prepare it to work with Mafalda SFU.
