Mafalda SFU shareable ESLint config

## üéõÔ∏è Available Configurations

<https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html>
<https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules#rule-structure>

- `@mafalda-sfu/eslint-config`: default configuration aggregating all the
  other configurations, acting as *recommended* one. One stop shop for all your
  linting needs.
  - `@mafalda-sfu/eslint-config/problems`: rules that detect possible errors in
    your code. It should be used before running actual tests to detect and fix
    errors as early as possible.
  - `@mafalda-sfu/eslint-config/format`: non-critical stylistic rules that are
    purely matters of taste and are highly unlikely to cause errors. They can
    safely be run after tests or before a commit, or ignored if you disagree
    with them.
    - `@mafalda-sfu/eslint-config/suggestions`: rules to identify alternative
      better ways of writing code.
    - `@mafalda-sfu/eslint-config/layout`: rules that enforce a consistent code
      style.
